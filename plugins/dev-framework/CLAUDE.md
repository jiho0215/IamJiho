# Dev Framework Plugin

Single-purpose plugin for AI-led, end-to-end software development. One command. One skill. One workflow.

## Core Philosophy

1. **One purpose.** AI leads development from requirement to completion. The user answers questions, discusses, confirms at two gates, and completes. Every file in this plugin exists to serve that single workflow.
2. **Move slow, do it right.** Reduce revisits and refactoring. Multi-agent consensus reviews with 10-iteration / 2-consecutive-zero convergence.
3. **Research-execution boundary is physical.** Phase 1-3 decisions are frozen in a single freeze doc artifact; src/** edits are blocked by a hook until the user approves at GATE 1; git push is blocked until GATE 2 approval.
4. **Language-agnostic.** Works with any tech stack. (Exception noted: `test-failure-capture.sh` default is `dotnet test` — override via `config.hooks.testCapture.testCommand`; tracked for correction.)
5. **Documentation as a first-class artifact.** `project-docs` protocol enforces `docs/` structure before any implementation begins.

## The Workflow

```
/dev [feature description]        Interactive full cycle (default)
/dev --autonomous TICKET-123       Autonomous full cycle
/dev --from N                      Resume at phase N
/dev --status                      Show current session status
/dev init                          Initialize a new project
/dev review                        Standalone review
/dev test                          Standalone test planning
/dev docs                          Standalone docs maintenance
```

Full cycle phases (both modes):

```
1. Requirements          (populates freeze doc §1, §5, §6)
2. Research              (populates freeze doc §2-§4, §7, §8)
3. Plan + Freeze Doc  →  🚪 GATE 1 (interactive approves; autonomous auto-approves with audit)
[freeze-gate hook ACTIVE — src/** edits blocked unless freeze doc APPROVED]
4. Test Planning
5. Implementation + Layer 1 Review (multi-agent consensus, 10 max / 2 zero)
6. Verification + Coverage Fill + Layer 2 Review (same convergence rules)
7. Documentation + Mistake Capture  →  🚪 GATE 2 (always interactive)
[push-guard hook — blocks git push until GATE 2 approved]
```

All protocol files are **internal references** read by `SKILL.md` via the Read tool. They are not discoverable as standalone skills and are not exposed to the user.

## User Gates

| Gate | Phase | Mode behavior | Physical artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GATE 1** — Freeze doc approval | End of Phase 3 | Interactive: user approves by category. Autonomous: auto-approves with audit note. | Freeze doc frontmatter `status: APPROVED` + `approvedAt`/`approvedBy`/`approvalMode`. |
| **GATE 2** — Final approval | End of Phase 7 | Always user-interactive (both modes). | `pipeline-complete.md` marker in session folder + progress-log `status: completed`. |

Between the two gates, `freeze-gate.sh` blocks src/** edits; after GATE 2, `push-guard.sh` allows `git push`.

## Execution Question Zones (Phases 4-7)

Four zones govern how the LLM handles questions during execution:

| Zone | Description | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 🛑 Frozen | Changes a freeze-doc §1-§8 decision | HALT; request ticket update |
| ✅ Non-Frozen | In `freezeDoc.nonFrozenAllowList` (observability, railroad, pure-function-composition) | May ask user |
| 🤔 Ambiguous | Technical, not covered above | 4-tier rule: existing code → follow; reference repo → follow; initial impl → ask; else → self-decide |
| ⚙️ Self-decide | Pure technical (naming, extraction, internal boundaries) | Decide without asking |

See `skills/dev/references/templates/FREEZE_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` §9 for the full "Ask with Suggestion" format.

## Config

All configuration lives in `~/.claude/autodev/config.json` (single source of truth). Created on first `/dev` invocation via `hooks/scripts/ensure-config.sh`. Every field has a documented fallback in `skills/dev/references/autonomous/session-management.md`.

Key sections:
- `pipeline.maxReviewIterations` (default 10)
- `pipeline.consecutiveZerosToExit` (default 2)
- `pipeline.testCoverageTarget` (default 90)
- `pipeline.skills.*` — per-phase skill mappings (swap in custom skills as needed)
- `pipeline.agents.plan`, `pipeline.agents.review` — agent rosters
- `pipeline.freezeDoc.categories` — 8 categories by default; extend to add custom categories (also drop a template into `~/.claude/autodev/freeze-categories/`)
- `pipeline.freezeDoc.nonFrozenAllowList` — question-allowed list during execution

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `load-chronic-patterns.sh` | SessionStart | Load recurring-mistake patterns into session context |
| `freeze-gate.sh` | PreToolUse (Edit\|Write) | Block src/** edits unless freeze doc is APPROVED for this feature on this branch |
| `push-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash git push) | Block `git push` until `pipeline-complete.md` marker exists (GATE 2 approval) or ticket-scoped bypass is active |
| `phase-gate.sh` | Called by SKILL.md | Validate progress-log.json at phase boundaries (begin/end). Blocks on failure (exit 2) |
| `phase-progress-validator.sh` | PostToolUse (phase-gate) | Independent post-gate consistency check (warning-only, exit 0) |
| `test-failure-capture.sh` | PostToolUse (dotnet test) | Log failed test runs to session folder (audit trail) |
| `precompact.sh` | PreCompact | Serialize pipeline state before context truncation |
| `sessionend.sh` | SessionEnd | Clean temp files, mark interrupted pipelines |

## Prerequisites

External skills the default config references. If any are unavailable, the phase that uses them operates without skill-specific guidance (graceful degradation):

| Config key | Default |
|---|---|
| `pipeline.skills.requirements` | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| `pipeline.skills.exploration` | `feature-dev:code-explorer` |
| `pipeline.skills.architect` | `feature-dev:code-architect` |
| `pipeline.skills.planning` | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| `pipeline.skills.tdd` | `superpowers:test-driven-development` |
| `pipeline.skills.implementation` | `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` |
| `pipeline.skills.implementationSequential` | `superpowers:executing-plans` |
| `pipeline.skills.implementationParallel` | `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` |
| `pipeline.skills.requestReview` | `superpowers:requesting-code-review` |
| `pipeline.skills.receiveReview` | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` |
| `pipeline.skills.verification` | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` |
| `pipeline.skills.finishing` | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` |
| `pipeline.skills.debugging` | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |

Override any mapping in `~/.claude/autodev/config.json` to swap in custom skills.

## Session State

Per-repo-branch session folders at `~/.claude/autodev/sessions/{repo}--{branch}/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `progress-log.json` + `.md` | Phase timing, metrics, status; includes `mode` (full-cycle, review, test, docs, init), `freezeDocPath`, `plannedFiles`, `featureSlug` |
| `decision-log.json` + `.md` | Every decision with reasoning |
| `pipeline-issues.json` | Review findings per phase |
| `tdd-plan.md` | Phase 4 output |
| `pipeline-complete.md` | GATE 2 marker (authorizes push) |
| `bypass.json` | Ticket-scoped freeze-gate override (live during session; deleted at GATE 2) |
| `bypass-audit.jsonl` | Durable bypass audit trail (written by `sessionend.sh` on crash/interrupt; merged into freeze doc `bypassHistory` at GATE 2, filtered by `runId`) |
| `test-failures.log` | Test failure audit trail (hook-written) |
